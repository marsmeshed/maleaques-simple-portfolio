# maleaques-simple-portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio to further my career and to ultimately land a software-engineering job. I built this project in order to showcase my learning capabilities and that I'm able to build anything I put my mind to. This portfolio will showcase my skills, whether an employer is on the fence about hiring me, this will assist me. Through creating this portfolio, I've learned more about coding and programming than any other project I've done to date, 10-24-22.
